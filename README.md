# CUSTOMER-BEHAVIOR-ANALYSIS
Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, exploratory analysis, cleaning, SQL querying, visualization, and business reporting.
The goal is to analyze customer shopping behavior and generate actionable insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The project is designed to reflect real-world analytics work and is suitable for showcasing to recruiters and hiring managers.

Dataset

Source: Customer Shopping Behavior dataset (CSV)

Content Includes:

Customer demographics

Purchase frequency and spending patterns

Product categories

Transaction-level information

The dataset is loaded and analyzed using Python, and later queried using SQL after being stored in a relational database.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Used for analytical queries and aggregations

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation

Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and documentation
