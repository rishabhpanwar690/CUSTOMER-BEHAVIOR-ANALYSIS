# CUSTOMER-BEHAVIOR-ANALYSIS
Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Science Project

Overview
This project demonstrates a data science–oriented analytical workflow, combining exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, SQL-based feature aggregation, and insight generation to understand customer shopping behavior.

Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to understand what drives customer spending behavior, which customer segments generate disproportionate value, and how purchasing patterns vary across categories and time.

Dataset
Source: Customer Shopping Behavior dataset (CSV)
The dataset includes customer demographics, purchase frequency, spending behavior, and product categories.

Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Power BI: Interactive dashboards
Jupyter Notebook: Reproducible analysis
Gamma: Executive presentation

Methodology
